**Task:** Act as a meticulous quality assurance checker. Your goal is to verify if the provided "Existing JSON Data" accurately reflects the linguistic analysis of the "Batch Text" according to a specific set of prior instructions (detailed below as "Verification Criteria"). If the existing data fully adheres to all criteria, return it unchanged. If any deviations are found, correct them rigorously based *only* on the Batch Text and the criteria, then return the corrected, complete, valid JSON object.

**Context:** The Existing JSON Data was generated by a previous LLM process instructed to perform detailed linguistic analysis (POS, lemma, translations, details, segments, idioms) following strict Spanish Universal Dependencies (UD) guidelines and specific formatting rules.

**Input:**

1.  **Batch Text:** The original source text segment.
    ```text
    {BATCH_TEXT_HERE}
    ```

2.  **Existing JSON Data:** The analysis to be verified.
    ```json
    {COMBINED_JSON_HERE}
    ```

**Verification Criteria (Derived from Prior Instructions):**

* **JSON Validity & Formatting:** Is the *entire* Existing JSON Data a single, perfectly valid JSON object? Are all keys/strings double-quoted? Are commas correct? CRITICAL: Is each `wordData` entry (`"1": { ... }`) on a single line? Is each `idiom` object (`{ ... }`) on a single line?
* **Punctuation Exclusion:** Does `wordData` contain *only* entries for actual words from the Batch Text? Are there *zero* entries for punctuation?
* **`wordData` - `word` Case:** Are all `word` values strictly lowercase?
* **`wordData` - `pos` Accuracy:** Is the `pos` tag for each word accurate according to Spanish Universal Dependencies (UD) standards and the word's specific context in the Batch Text? (Pay attention to VERB/AUX, PRON/DET/SCONJ, ADP/ADV distinctions).
* **`wordData` - `lemma` Accuracy & Format:** Is the `lemma` the precise, orthographically correct canonical form? Is it strictly lowercase? CRITICAL: Does it include all necessary accent marks (diacritics) (e.g., él, más, sé, saber, capitán)? Are contraction lemmas correct (del=de, al=a)? Are pronoun lemmas standard (e.g., yo, él, se)?
* **`wordData` - Independent Analysis:** Does the `pos` and `lemma` for each word appear to be derived from its specific context, or was analysis potentially copied incorrectly from identical word forms elsewhere?
* **`wordData` - `lemma_translations` Format:** Do ONLY verb lemmas start with "to "?
* **`wordData` - `best_translation` Literalness:** Is it the single best *literal* (core dictionary meaning) translation of the word *in its specific context*? Is it distinct from potential idiomatic meanings? Are components of idioms translated literally? Does it include implied subjects in brackets (e.g., (I), (he/she/it)) correctly for verbs?
* **`wordData` - `details` - String Values:** Are ALL values within the `details` object strings (e.g., "1", "Past")?
* **`wordData` - `details` - Gender/Number Format:** CRITICAL: Is the format *exclusively* m/f/n for Gender and s/p for Number? Are "Masc", "Fem", "Sing", "Plur" ABSENT?
* **`wordData` - `details` - Feature Appropriateness:** Are the UD features applied correctly for the given `pos` tag? Is `Case` present and correct for PRON? Are `details` for contractions (`del`/`al`) empty or minimal? Are ambiguous persons listed correctly (e.g., Person="1,3")? Are clitic features correctly included in the main VERB entry?
* **`segmentData` - Translations:** Are `en_variant1` (literal) and `en_variant2` (natural) present and accurate based on the Batch Text?
* **`idioms` - Validity & Scoring:** Are the identified phrases truly non-compositional idioms/set phrases (excluding proper names, compositional phrases)? Is the `idiomaticity_score` (1-3) appropriate based on the definitions provided previously (Fixed Collocation=1, Standard Figurative=2, Opaque=3)? Is the `meaning`/`translation` accurate?

**Instructions:**

1.  Carefully compare the Existing JSON Data against the Batch Text and ALL Verification Criteria listed above.
2.  If **any** criterion is not met, correct the specific value(s) in the JSON data to ensure full compliance. Base corrections *only* on the Batch Text and the criteria.
3.  If the Existing JSON Data **already meets all criteria perfectly**, return it exactly as provided.
4.  Output **only** the final, verified (and potentially corrected), complete, valid JSON object. Ensure perfect JSON syntax and correct `\uXXXX` escaping for all Unicode characters. No extra text, comments, or markdown.

**Output:** (Return ONLY the verified/corrected JSON object below)
```json
{
  "wordData": {
    // Verified or corrected word entries here...
  },
  "segmentData": {
    // Verified or corrected segment entry here...
  },
  "idioms": [
    // Verified or corrected idiom entries here...
  ]
}
